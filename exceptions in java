java.lang.stackoverflowerror 

Check for any recusive calls for methods. Mainly it is caused when there is recursive call for a method. A simple example is
public static void main(String... args) {
    Main main = new Main();

    main.testMethod(1);
}

public void testMethod(int i) {
    testMethod(i);

    System.out.println(i);
}
Here the System.out.println(i); will be repeatedly pushed to stack when the testMethod is called.
